**Warning: this library is unmaintained, inefficient and probably broken. I would not recommend using it for anything production-worthy, unless there is really no alternative.**

**Also note that the 'rdfaparser' subpackage is broken as a result of a backwards incompatible API change in one of its dependencies. The 'rdf' subpackage, which depends on 'rdfaparser', is hence also broken.**

An RDF manipulation, parsing and serialisation library, written in Go.
